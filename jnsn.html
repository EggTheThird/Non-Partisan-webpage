Some of the party's goals include cutting taxes, decreasing national debt, eliminating the IRS, ending capital punishment, and decriminalizing marijuana. The party's primary focus is on individual liberty, including the rights to bea arms, marry your same gender, and refuse Social Security."

	document.getElementById("js2").innerHTML="Johnson prioritizes freedom in all his government policy. This explains his leftist social views:his opposition to the War on Drugs and pro-choice stance. Unlike his liberal opponents, Johnson proposes a flat rate tax and plans to cut all taxes. Though he claims skepticism toward Global Trade, he has stated that he agrees with the Trans Pacific Partnership. Johnsons's main approach to politics has placed an emphasis on limited federal power in favor of state and individual rights."

	function myFunction2() {
	document.getElementById("js3").innerHTML="Johnson has a background in political science, receiving his bachelors degree in the subject from the University of New Mexico. He then went on to serve as the Republican Governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003. Low tax and anti-crime policies categorized his two terms in office, as well as his strong stance against the War on Drugs and his campaign to decriminalize marijuana. Preceding his life in politics, Johnson founded one of the largest companies in his state of New Mexico. In 2012, he ran against Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as a libertarian."

		document.getElementById("js4").innerHTML="While many people fail to recognize third party candidates, Gary Johnson has received a considerable amount of support and attention this election season. Currently, the libertarian candidate is polling with as many as 15% of American voters."
