		document.getElementById("js1").innerHTML="Clinton faced off in the primaries against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Maryland Governor Martin O'malley. She performed strongly in the debates, relying slightly on the power of name recognition and the success of her political history. Her campaign was not devoid of criticism, however. Many people rejected her more liberal policies for being disparate to past political leanings, and the controversy of her email scandal had negative impact on voter favorability. Running against lesser known and slightly more radical opponents, her success at the primary's commencement seemed undisputed. On the contrary, Bernie Sanders put up an exceptional fight against the considerably more established Clinton, even refusing to drop out once she became the presumptive nominee in June of 2016."
		}
	function myFunction1() {
	document.getElementById("js2").innerHTML="Clinton boasts a policy that will promote civil unity and protect the social rights of all Americans. Her political background facilitates foreign and immigration policies that preserve the United State's world power status while limiting military spending and accepting more refugees. Her proposed tax plan will hold corporations and members of the 1% to higher tax rates than working and middle class Americans. Like Jill Stein, Clinton has expressed her interest in halting climate change through increased environmental regulations. On the issue of gun control, Clinton is vocally supportive of regulating firearm ownership through background checks and the banning of assault weapons.Following the lead of current President Barack Obama, Clinton hopes to establish free healthcare and maintain and improve upon the present Obamacare."
		}
	function myFunction2() {
	document.getElementById("js3").innerHTML="Hillary Clinton has a long history in United States Government.While receiving her Juris Degree from Yale Law School, Clinton met former US President Bill Clinton. Upon his election in 1994, Hillary became the First Lady of the United States, where she worked on issues of health care and gender equality. In 2001, Clinton furthered these initiatives through her election to Senate. Following this was her campaign for President in the 2008 election. Though she was not the Democrat nominee, following Obama's election she was made Secretary of State. Clinton maintained this position from 2009 to 2013."
		}
		function myFunction3() {
		document.getElementById("js4").innerHTML="The race between Trump and Clinton is undeniably close. However, currently holding 46% of the American vote, Hillary Clinton is projected to beat Donald Trump by 2% in the presidential election. This number is, obviously, subject to change. Due to her liberal social policies, Hillary Clinton is at higher risk of losing voters to the third party candidates such as Stein and Johnson who share these views in addition to their more specialized platforms."
