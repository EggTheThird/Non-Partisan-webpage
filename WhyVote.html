	<p><b>More than previous elections, this particular race has been met with a lack of enthusiasm from voters.
	Many people dismiss their decision between Trump and Clinton as "the lesser of two evils.Despite this,it is a 
	responsibility of Americans to to elect the person they feel is most qualified to be commander in chief.
	This decision should be informed by and unbiased understanding of each candidates' policies and their plans 
	of execution. When voting, it is important to recognize the long lasting affects presidencies have on American politics.
	For instance, the next president will most likely be in the position to nominate more than one supreme court justice in 
	his or her next term. This is important and a compelling reason to vote because justices remain on SCOTUS for life.</b></p>
